:point_right: Having taught history and geography for many years, I developed a deep love for understanding past events and their impact on our modern world. 
However, ever since I was a child, I've also been drawn to the realm of coding and technology. and i have just finished a bootcamp @ LeWagon in Paris.

:student: I love to learn ! I'm committed to acquiring new skills, languages and technologies to enrich my journey as a developer.


<h3 align="left"> ðŸ”­ Today, I'm actively seeking an opportunity as a Junior Developer.r</h3>
