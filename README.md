<h4 align="left">Hello everyone! ðŸ‘‹, I'm David</h1>

I'm excited to introduce my journey and passions through my GitHub profile. Having taught history and geography for many years, I developed a deep love for understanding past events and their impact on our modern world. However, ever since I was a child, I've also been drawn to the realm of coding and technology.

<h4 align="center">Today, I'm actively seeking an opportunity as a Junior Developer.r</h3>

Feel free to explore my GitHub projects to get a glimpse of my skills in action. I'm open to collaboration, advice, and opportunities that will allow me to continue growing as a developer.

Thank you for taking the time to explore my GitHub profile. I look forward to seeing where this new adventure in the world of development will take me!
